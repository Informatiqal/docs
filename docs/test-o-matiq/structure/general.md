# General

The general section is quite simple with only 3 (optional) properties:

- author - who is the person that wrote the tests
- description - longer description of what the test suite is supposed to test.
- version- the current version of the test suite

## Example

```js
{
...
"author: "John Doe",
"description": "Set of tests to data check XXX app",
"version": "0.0.1"
...
}
```
