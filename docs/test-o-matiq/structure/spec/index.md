# Spec

As mentioned in the main page data tests are separated in two sections:

## [Meta](./meta/index.md)

Test the overall status of an app - general "health" of the app without going into to much details about the data itself

## [Data](./data/index.md)

This section allows us to specify list of test cases to be executed in sequence.
